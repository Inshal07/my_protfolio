            <div class="text">
              <p class="card-text">I'm a Frontend Web-Developer, Co-Founder of PathoDux, Design Enthusiast, and a BE Computer Engineer. As an Frontend developer, I have a deep understanding of the <b>Angular framework</b>  and its capabilities.</p>
                  <p class="card-text"> I have 2 years of experience in developing web applications and have honed my skills in Angular, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My experience has allowed me to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
              I have a strong grasp of Angular architecture and am proficient in creating custom components, services, and directives to enhance the functionality of the application. I also have experience working with RESTful APIs and databases, and have a good understanding of Agile development methodologies</p>
              <p class="card-text">
                I am committed to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code, and I have a strong eye for detail. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in web development.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                As an Angular developer, I have always been passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly web applications. That's why I have decided to expand my skills and knowledge by learning UI/UX design. I understand that great design is essential for creating a positive user experience and is a key factor in the success of any web application.
I am currently studying the principles of UI/UX design, including design theory, user research, prototyping, and testing. I have a good hands-on on design tools such as Figma, and Adobe XD, and how to use them to create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs.</p>
